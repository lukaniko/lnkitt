# lnkitt
LN K.I.T.T. lights effects for nodeMCU (arduino IDE code) with effects and wifi android app

What do you need:<br>
1 - A nodeMCU ESP8266 or ESP12E<br>
2 - 8 Led<br>
3 - A 1000 Ohm resistor<br>
4 - Arduino IDE program with ESP8266 libraryes<br>
5 - USB cable<br>

How to proceed:<br>
1 - Preapare the nodeMCU on a breadboard or similar and made the circuit. (see scheme image)<br>
2 - Install the Arduino IDE, download here : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software <br>
3 - Follow the tutorial to install the ESP8266 libraryes : https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/<br>
4 - Connect the nodeMCU to the pc with the USB cable <br>
5 - Check and set the COM port where the nodeMCU is connected under TOOLS -> Port <br>
6 - Load the lnkitt-wifi-xxx.ino into the Arduino IDE program <br>
7 - Upload the Sketch to the nodeMCU <br>
8 - Now you can download and install the lnkitt-wifi-xxx.apk into your android smarthphone<br> (must remove the google apps restriction)<br>
9 - Turn on the smartphone wifi, scan and find the ESPxxxx access point and connect to this<br>
10 - Open the lnkitt app. you can find some type of effects and you can change the speed (N.B. lower value = speed faster)<br>
